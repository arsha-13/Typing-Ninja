### Project Description
Typing Ninja is a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping word typing game built with Python‚Äôs Tkinter. by this game your speed, accuracy, and focus as you race against the clock to type the words correctly. With multiple difficulty levels, a live timer, high score tracking, and instant feedback this game keeps you on your toes. Perfect for improving typing skills or just proving you‚Äôre the fastest typist in the room!


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world where people scroll endlessly but can‚Äôt type "banana" without looking at the keyboard, society faces a grave crisis: slow typing.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a game that makes you type faster ‚Äî not because you need it, but because your self-esteem demands it.Typing Ninja turns the challenge of typing practice into a fun and competitive game.
Instead of staring at boring text, players get instant visual feedback, dynamic word lists, and a race-against-time challenge
